## Hello there 

I'm Omar, passionate about data science and physics. I'm looking to use technological tools and knowledge to bring well-being to people.

I'll be uploading my journey through data science and any topic that catches my attention.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a grain classification system, inspired by my brother, I want to challenge my skills in creating deep learning models and optimized them as much as possible.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning data science, with projects based on real-life data.
